# Monster's Rollodex

![](monsters_sample.gif)

This is my very first completed project with React JS. Here you can search for specific monsters by name in the search bar and it will correctly display the monster 
matching the search bar in real-time. I'm fetching the monsters from an API and displaying them using React.
